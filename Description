Digit Recognition Using Python and Kaggle Library

Project Overview:
Digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision.
The objective is to correctly identify handwritten digits from images, which can be a fundamental building block for more complex image recognition tasks.
In this project, we leverage the Kaggle library to access the popular MNIST dataset, a well-known benchmark dataset for handwritten digit classification.
