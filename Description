Digit Recognition Using Python and Kaggle Library

Project Overview:
Digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision.
The objective is to correctly identify handwritten digits from images, which can be a fundamental building block for more complex image recognition tasks.
In this project, we leverage the Kaggle library to access the popular MNIST dataset, a well-known benchmark dataset for handwritten digit classification.

I used mnist data set 
which again consist of two data sets of x_train and y_train.

I train my model using condition:
model.fit(x_train,y_train,batch_size=64,epochs=10,verbose=1,validation split=0.2)

Accuracy prediction is about 97% .
